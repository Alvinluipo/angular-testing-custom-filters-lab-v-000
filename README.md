# Testing filters with Jasmine/Karma

## Objectives

- Write unit tests for our custom filters

## Instructions

In this repo we've got two filters.

The first filter is gender - it will filter an array of objects depending on the `gender` property in the object. Test that this filter is filtering a mocked example list of people correctly.

The second is a filter to remove all the vowels in a string. Test that this removes every vowel in any string given to the filter.
